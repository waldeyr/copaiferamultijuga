            <h2> About the project</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In this study, we performed the gene annotation of previously assembled contigs, comprising the complete Copaiba's transcriptome, using BLAST and eukaryotic protein sequences downloaded from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and BRENDA databases. Several Perl scripts were used in order to determine the EC (Enzyme Commission number)related to each contig. A list of ECs involved in the secondary metabolism was submitted to the KEGG pathway tool for metabolic mapping.<br />
                Out of 62.839 contigs, we could annotate 18.945 (30,14%) contigs of which 5.373 contigs were annotated as enzymes related to secondary metabolism. In total 383 different enzymes of the secondary metabolism could be identified. We could identify all the main components of the Copaiba oil: terpenes (1.145 contigs), monoterpenes (1.553 contigs), diterpenes (1.301 contigs), triterpenes (1.122 contigs) and sesquiterpenes (1.290 contigs) and others components of secondary metabolism.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The resin-oil produced by the Copaíba trees as a defense mechanism against its predators has been used in traditional medicine over 500 years. Some medicinal properties of Copaiba's essential oil were scientifically proven, such as anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. Through the Copaiba's transcriptome, the metabolic pathways could be determined, particularly those involved in the terpenoid production, the main oil components.
